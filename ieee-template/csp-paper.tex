\section{INTRODUCTION \& MOTIVATION}

Imaging a big factory, if we want the factory be smart enough, there must be some robots that can pick and place and even move something gigantic together.

About path-planning or manipulation or multi-robot system, there are many existing platform. For example, MicroMVP$^{1}$ is a platform that focusing on multi-robot behavior and Pheeno$^{2}$ is a robot that focus on manipulation while moving and can do cooperative manipulation. However, none of them can do path-planning and cooperative manipulation at the same time. Therefore, we want to build a system that the user can do the path planning and task planning, while the robot can follow the commands to move to the right place and do cooperative manipulation. By this, we can make a factory much more intelligent.

Also, we will add Scratch in this project. Since programming of K12 is popular and get more attention worldwide. We plan to let the user program though Scratch.

\section{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \& EQUIPMENTS}

\subsection{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE}
The DuckieMVP including three parts, motion capture camera, center control computer and robots. (Fig. 1) The whole system acts like aliens controlled by a center-control, powerful "brain" in movies. The whole system is based on Robot Operating System ,Duckietown and MicroMVP.

\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{system_diagram1}

\caption{The basic system diagram of DickieMVP}
 \label{figure:system_diagram1}
\end{figure}

The function of the motion-capture camera is to capture images from above which contains two-dimensional bar codes that specifies the locations of robots.  The camera is connected with computer with ethernet.

The most important part in DuckieMVP is the center control computer. Before all the algorithm and commands, the control center will get images from camera and decode the tags to find out the locations of each robots. After calculating and decision making, the control center will send commands to robots. For end user, there's a panel for user to interact and add commands to the system. Three main functions will be add to the control system. First, it can produce a trajectory for robots to follow, which is one of the crucial parts in the system. After producing a trajectory, an algorithm will compute the thrusts of right and left wheels for robots to receive and follow the path while the robots are differential drive robots (DDR). Second, the control system can compute a trajectory for a fleet of robots to follow. A fleet do not just follow the trajectory randomly, but will follow the trajectory according to some center of the mass. Third, the robots can cooperatively manipulate an object.

Each of the robots is basically a differential drive robots (DDR) with a gripper. They act like slaves of the control center. It will get every command from the center including thrust of motors and movement of the grippers. The robots will be looked over by motion-capture camera and form a closed-loop control system.

\end{figure}

\subsection{EQUIPMENTS} 

The camera is composed of a Raspberry Pi 3 and a camera without fisheye lens. (Fig. 3) The camera will connect with control center through ethernet.

 \label{figure:mocap}
\end{figure}

The control center is an ordinary computer with an CPU of i5 and without GPU. (Fig. 4) There's a interactive panel for user. Also, we will set up scratch interface for programming.

\end{figure}

About the robots, we will take MIT 2.12 lab robots with a three axis arm and gripper as reference. (Fig. 5) We may modify the robots to suit our need. Of course, Duckiebot DB17 will definitely be part of the project. Classic never loss!

\section{SPECIFIC AIMS}

\begin{itemize}
\item The robots can follow a trajectory by the commands from control center individually.
\item The center of mass of a fleet of robots can follow the trajectory
\item Robots can cooperatively manipulate an object.
\item Users can use the system through Scratch and create education value
\item Building an easy-to-use interface enable all level of end user.
\end{itemize}

\section{APPROACH}

DuckieMVP is based on Robot Operating System which will reduce the connection problem. For the apriltag detection, we will take the package in Duckietown as reference. We will create a new package in Duckietown workspace so that we can take advantage of original Duckietown packages. The commands interface and DDR algorithm will be transplanted from MicroMVP and added into DuckieMVP package. Also, the algorithm of fleet control will be implemented inside the DuckieMVP package. 

For Scratch, we know that there's a way for Scratch communicate with ROS node, and already make a prototype. We wil build an interface for user can control system through Scratch programming.

\section{SCHEDULE AND TEAM COLLABORATION}

We plan to complete the project in about two months. The whole project is divided into three parts, the basic trajectory following, trajectory followed by fleets and cooperative manipulation. We plan to finish the basic trajectory following in first week since we have started the project already. Then, we will use four weeks to study on how the fleet can following the trajectory and implement the function. After that we will spend last four weeks on cooperative manipulation. We will integrate the previous function to achieve our goal.
